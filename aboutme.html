    <h1>MORE ABOUT MYSELF</h1>
  <section>        
        <p>I’m just an everyday person navigating the ups and downs of life.I'm a mother of 1year old daughter her name is JHELLAN RHYN TEVES.Ilove her so much.As a dedicated mother to my one-year-old daughter, my life is a beautiful blend of nurturing and learning. Each day brings new adventures as I watch her explore the world around her, and I cherish every moment we share. Balancing motherhood with my college studies can be challenging, but it also fuels my determination to create a better future for us both. I strive to set a positive example for my daughter, showing her the importance of education and perseverance. Between diaper changes and late-night study sessions, I find joy in the little things, whether it’s a giggle from my daughter or the satisfaction of acing an exam. This journey is not just about raising her; it’s about growing together and embracing the challenges and triumphs that come our way.I really  love traveling the world, and theres nothing I enjoy more than exploring new places with my loved ones by my side. Each trip is an opportunity to create lasting memories. Alongside my love for travel, I also have a creative side that shines through in my DIY clothing projects. I find joy in transforming fabrics into unique pieces that reflect my personal style, allowing me to express myself in a fun and sustainable way. Whether I’m stitching together a new outfit or planning our next adventure, I embrace the thrill of creativity and the joy of shared experiences, making every moment count. </p>
